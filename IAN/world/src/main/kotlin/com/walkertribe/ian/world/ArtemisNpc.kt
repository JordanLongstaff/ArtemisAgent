/**
 * An NPC ship; they may have special abilities, and can be scanned.
 *
 * The Artemis server sometimes sends garbage data for the special abilities
 * properties when a vessel does not have special abilities. The
 * [.getSpecialBits] and [.getSpecialStateBits] methods
 * preserve the exact data sent by the server. The other methods related to
 * special abilities will attempt to reconcile this with the information parsed
 * from vesselData.xml. If the vessel spec indicates that it can't have special
 * abilities, then these methods will never report that it has them, regardless
 * of what is reported by received packets. If the vessel cannot be determined
 * (because the hull ID is unspecified or does not correspond to a known
 * vessel), these methods will indicate that it cannot reliably make a
 * determination.
